                        <h1>What is Fighing Fantasy?</h1>
                        <p>No it's not an attempt to remove fantasy from the world, in fact I would like to see more in the world.</p>
                        <p>Fighting Fantasy is actually a book series (I believe there are 53 of them) of choose your own adventure gamebooks. This means not only are they choose your own adventure, but they are RPG/Table top games requiring dice to be rolled for battles and other situations.</p>

                        <h2>Okay so why am I looking at a web application about books?</h2>
                        <p>Well there are a couple of reasons for that.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>I'm lazy and don't know where my dice are.</li>
                            <li>I wanted to code something.</li>
                            <li>I can't give you the books but I can give you a free system to play them if you find them.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <section>
                        <h2>So what is this web app?</h2>
                        <p>Put simple this web app is to handle the encounters meet in a fighting fantasy book.</p>
                        <p>This Python Flask web app is designed to accept your characters stats and those of any enemy encountered and complete the following:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Roll your dice</li>
                            <li>Roll the enemy dice</li>
                            <li>Calculate who won the round</li>
                            <li>Ask if you would like to use luck to modify the outcome of the round</li>
                            <li>Calculate damage agains you or the enemy</li>
                            <li>Keep track of health until you or the enemy is dead</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Comming soon features!</h3>
                        <p>The scope of this app is growing rapidly in my mind so it's going to take a bit to code it all out. Here's a list of things I would like to add to the application:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Book of monsters (database containing all the encounter enemies with their stats, encounter page updated to allow click on enemy for encounter)</li>
                            <li>^^^^ This may need to be broken out by book as I believe some monsters have different stats in different books of the series</li>
                            <li>Test your luck (TYL, 2 die roll, with modifier options, for non combat luck rolls)</li>
                            <li>Inventory system</li>
                            <li>Map (this is a huge undertaking, not sure how I would want to do this yet)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </footer>
                </article>

                    <h3>What else can it do?</h3>
                    <p>My inspiration for this Python Flask web app project was the Fighting Fantasy series but I see no reason this application couldn't be adjusted for other series of similar books. Please feel free to fork/clone from my Github repo and modify the application to fit your needs.</p>
